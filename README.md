I installed tkinter and Pillow a while ago and I do not use macOS or Linux so the installation instructions may be wrong. You may need to install tkinter and Pillow separatly.
## Windows:

Open the Command Prompt by pressing Windows Key + R, then typing cmd and pressing Enter.

Type the following command and press Enter: pip install tkinter Pillow

Wait for the installation to complete.

## macOS:

Open the Terminal app by searching for it in Spotlight.

Type the following command and press Enter: pip3 install tkinter Pillow

Wait for the installation to complete.

## Linux:

Open the Terminal app by searching for it in your system's applications.

Type the following command and press Enter: sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-pil

Wait for the installation to complete.
